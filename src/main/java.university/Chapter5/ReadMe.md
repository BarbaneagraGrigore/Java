## So, what you're going to do is allow the user to input the plan fee and the number of overage minutes. And then you're going to charge 25 cents for every minute that they've gone over, and then a 15% tax on the subtotal.

I want you to create separate methods to calculate the tax, to calculate the overage fees, and to calculate and print the final total.

Please print this as an itemized bill. 
I have an example of the output expected down below.

    Enter base cost of the plan: 82.45
    Enter overage minutes: 9
    Phone Bill Statement
    Plan: $82.45
    Overage: $2.25
    Tax: $12.71
    Total: $97.41
